Maven JiBX Plugin

 The Maven 2 JiBX Plugin. This plugin runs the JiBX binding compiler, the JiBX source code
 generator, and several other JiBX utilities.
 
 Note: The JiBX plugin has been renamed jibx-maven-plugin to conform to maven plugin conventions.
 The old plugin name (jibx-maven-plugin) is still supported.
